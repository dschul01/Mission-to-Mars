# Mission-to-Mars
Utilize web scraping to extract Mars facts and images

## Overview
The purpose of this project is to automate a web browser to scrape data from different websites, store in MongoDB and create a new website using Flask.  The project utilizes Python, VS Code, BeautifulSoup, Splinter, MongoDB, Flask and Bootstrap components.  

The final produced website contains allows the user to scrape new data each time they want updated information.  The button within the Jumbotron triggers the process of scraping different data elements from other websites:

* The first element provides the latest news about Mars
* The second element provides a featured image of Mars
* The third element provides a facts table comparing key metrics of Mars and Earth
* The fourth element provides images and titles of the four hemispheres of Mars.

## Utilizing Bootstrap 3 Components to Customize the Website 
A couple items were customized utilizing Bootstrap 3 components to change the look of the website.  The Jumbotron background was adjusted to red to play on the fact Mars is considered the 'red planet'.  Additionally, I modified the thumbnails of the four hemispheres to align better on the screen and not be so obtrusive as seen below:

## Making Website Mobile-Responsive
An important component to be added to websites is the ability for them to be mobile responsive which will adjust the page to nicely fit onto other devices' screens.  The screenshot below shows my website is built to do just that.
